## GenomeSize

Project to test/play with genome-size esetimates from kmers and correlations with other traits.

#### Plan 

Jellyfish kmer counting, gce to do genome size estimation. 
Correlate those with actual genome size data from Bilinski. 
If estimates of genome size match, use kmer methods in NAM RILs to look for flowering time effects.

#### Files

seed_size.Rmd: R markdown of NAM genome size from Chia et al. vs. phenotype data from Panzea. 
Shows plant height flowering time correlation, but not with seed size.
